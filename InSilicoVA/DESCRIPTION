Description: Computes individual causes of death and population cause-specific mortality fractions using the 'InSilicoVA' algorithm from McCormick et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2016.1152191>. It uses data derived from verbal autopsy (VA) interviews, in a format similar to the input of the widely used 'InterVA' method. This package provides general model fitting and customization for 'InSilicoVA' algorithm and basic graphical visualization of the output.
